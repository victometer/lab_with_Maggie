Write a function that accepts an int with 10 numbers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example
```
create_phone_number(1234567890) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
